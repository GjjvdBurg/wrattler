# Wrattler

Wrattler is an polyglot notebook environment for exploratory data science. Wrattler
uses provenance tracking to guarantee reproducibility of your data analyses. Its
architecture makes it possible to mix multiple programming languages in a single notebook
and also to create interactive tools that run fully in the web browser. Wrattler
is implemented as an extension to JupyterLab,

For more information about Wrattler,  instructions on getting started and guides on
how to extend Wrattler, see [the Wrattler documentation](https://wrattler.github.io/wrattler/).
